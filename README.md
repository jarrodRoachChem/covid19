This is a shortened version of all of the code used for "SARS-CoV-2 infection unevenly impacts metabolism in the coronal periphery of the lungs". I have tried to the best of my ability to break-up the code into digestible pieces, but it is fairly complicated code that, admittedly, could have been written more eloquently by a more skilled coder. I have also attempted to put the figure number that the piece of code generated above each chunk of code.
